# 5 Day Weather Forecast
Challenge 6 - 5 day weather forecast dashboard

## Description

This project has been an ongoing challenge for me.  I've been able to learn more things during the bootcamp process and come back and have been able to put things into play.  One thing that I found while putting this project together, has been the different reference materials and the sites that help you play with your code.  I fell in love with the JASS site, there is a link below.  It was able to show me what I was doing, along with checking my code.  I was able to discover commas and semicolons that were missing with using this.  Also, where things weren't being called appropriately due to typos.  

For this project, the 5-Day-Forcast will allow you to search for your city, then display the weather for your current city and let you see what the weather will be for the following five days.  You will also be able to see what cities you previously searched and just click on them again in order to see what the weather is.
